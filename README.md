### ‚úàÔ∏è Intelligent Seat Recommendations
- **Flight Direction Analysis**: Calculates optimal seating based on flight path
- **Sun Position Tracking**: Considers sun exposure during flight
- **Time-of-Day Analysis**: Different recommendations for day/night/mixed flights
- **Long-Haul Considerations**: Special recommendations for extended flights
- **Comprehensive Airport Database**: 100+ major airports worldwide

### üéØ Smart Features
- **Real-time Sun Position**: Updates based on departure time
- **Flight Path Visualization**: Shows route on 3D Earth
- **Multiple Recommendation Factors**: Side preference, window vs aisle, sun exposure
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and visualization
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Custom Shaders**: Atmospheric effects and lighting
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Modern ES6+ features
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Responsive UI design
- **8K Textures**: Ultra-high resolution Earth textures

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5175`

## Usage

### Getting Seat Recommendations

1. **Enter Flight Details**:
   - **Source**: Enter departure city (e.g., "New York", "London", "Tokyo")
   - **Destination**: Enter arrival city
   - **Departure Time**: Select date and time
   - **Flight Duration**: Enter flight duration in hours

2. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Get Recommendations" to analyze your flight

3. **View Results**: The application will display:
   - Optimal seat side (left/right)
   - Window vs aisle recommendations
   - Reasoning for each recommendation
   - Flight path visualization on the 3D Earth

### 3D Earth Interaction

- **Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate the Earth
- **Zoom**: Scroll to zoom in/out (enhanced range for larger Earth)
- **Auto-rotation**: Earth automatically rotates for dynamic viewing
- **Flight Path**: Red line shows your flight route when recommendations are generated

## How It Works

### Seat Recommendation Algorithm

The application analyzes multiple factors to provide optimal seat recommendations:

1. **Flight Direction**: Calculates bearing from source to destination
2. **Sun Position**: Determines sun exposure during flight
3. **Time Analysis**: Considers departure and arrival times
4. **Duration**: Factors in flight length for comfort considerations
5. **Seasonal Effects**: Accounts for Earth's axial tilt and seasonal changes

### 3D Earth Implementation

- **Geometry**: High-detail icosahedron (16 subdivisions) for ultra-smooth Earth surface
- **8K Textures**: Ultra-resolution Earth textures from [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/)
- **Larger Size**: 50% larger Earth (1.5x scale) for better visibility
- **Materials**: Multiple material layers (surface, lights, atmosphere)
- **Lighting**: Dynamic sun positioning and atmospheric scattering
- **Shaders**: Custom fresnel shader for atmospheric glow

### High-Resolution Textures

The application uses **8K ultra-resolution Earth textures** from [Solar System Scope](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/):
